    "## 2020 US Presidential Elections\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Presidential election has always been of great worldwide interest, not only because US is considered to be a superpower but also because the US has noteworthy significance bearing on international affairs. People around the globe tend to view America through the figure of its President. The 2020 election particularly has been under greater speculation, as it not only matters for the United States but will also shape the international landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "This election is between the **<span style='color:Red'> incumbent President Donald Trump </span>** and the **<span style='color:Blue'>former Vice President Joe Biden </span>** as the major candidates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to forecast the 2020 election results using survey data and by simulating 1000 paths for the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This work aims to collect polling data from various sources and simulate the election results to find the likely winner for the 2020 US election. The motivation for this project is to predict -\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final electoral score\n",
    "- Democratic candidate Biden's chance of winning the election\n",
    "- Battleground states\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "### 3.1 <u>Data Collection, Cleaning and Preparation of DataFrame</u>\n",
    "#### 3.1.1 Preparing the Dataframe\n",
    "The first step was to create a dataframe that included the following information about the 2020 election \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b> State </b>\n",
    "* <b> Poll date: </b>  Date the poll was conducted.\n",
    "* <b> Sample Size: </b> Polls contain the sample size. This number was before either LV (likely voters) and RV(registered) voters. For the purposes of this project, this distinction has been ignored.\n",
    "* <b> Pollster Name:</b> This included the name of the polling organization. The organization that contributed the most intellectual property to the methodology and execution of the poll.\n",
    "* <b> Pollster Grade: </b> A letter grade from A+ to F that reflects a pollster's Predictive Plus-Minus score. An “A/B” provisional rating means that the pollster has shown strong initial results, a “B/C” rating means it has average initial results, and a “C/D” rating means below-average initial results.\n",
    "* <b> Pollster Bias: </b> A pollster's historical average statistical bias toward Democratic or Republican candidates, reverted to a mean of zero based on the number of polls in the database.\n",
    "* <b> Reported Proportion for Biden: </b> Reported proportion for Biden as per the polling organization in each state\n",
    "* <b> Reported Proportion for Trump: </b> Reported proportion for Trump as per the polling organization in each state\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project was collected from the following sources from January 2020 to October 2020: \n",
    "\n",
    "- <a href='https://www.270towin.com/2020-polls-biden-trump/' target='_blank'>270towin.com</a>\n",
    "- <a href='https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/' target='_blank'>fivethirtyeight.com</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The 270towin website displays the Polling Average for each state. The FiveThirtyEight website provides information about the pollster ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant information from the above sites were used for further analysis of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Points to note:</u>\n",
    "a. When the proportions of vote for Biden and Trump do not equal 100%, the remaining was split equally between Biden and Trump such that the sum was 100%. Columns 'Reported Proportion for Biden' and 'Reported Proportion for Trump' represent the adjusted values. <br>\n",
    "b. Two new columns were created:\n",
    "* Estimated proportion of the vote $\\hat{p}$ Biden wins\n",
    "* Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ of $\\hat{p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Due to mismatch in the pollster names gathered from 2 sources - '270towin' and 'fivethirtyeight', the Bias and Grade details for some pollsters were missing after merging the data. This was handled by assigning a Grade of '0' and a Bias of '0' for such polls. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A snapshot of the merged data is shown below."
